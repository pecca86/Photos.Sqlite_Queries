# Photos.Sqlite_Queries
SQLite query templates that may help with decoding some of the data stored in Photos.sqlite. These queries are based on testing, research and some community published research. These queries were written to work for the Photos.sqlite database stored at \private\var\mobile\Media\PhotoData\Photos.sqlite within an iPhone. 

My research started in 2020 and since that time, I have continued to research and update the queries. The initial write up was posted via Heather Mahalikâ€™s blog at https://smarterforensics.com/. The write up as later reviewed and validated by DFRWS: https://dfir.pubpub.org/pub/v19rksyf/release/1
